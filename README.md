# CapyShell

CapyShell is a modern, minimalistic, and highly customizable window manager for Linux targeting tiling window managers (currently only supports Hyprland).

## Features

CapyShell includes multiple "panels" who substitute your taskbar, notification center, settings, etc.

### Taskbar

The taskbar includes your workspaces, media controls, active application and system info

#### Workspaces

The workspaces are displayed as a row of buttons, each representing a workspace. The active workspace is highlighted with the primary color. The icon of the active app is shown in the center of the workspace button.
The icons are fetched with a custom icon finder that should find every icon on your system. If not, please open an issue on GitHub with app that is missing the icon, installation method (pacman, aur, flatpak, etc.) & the path the icon should be found on.
